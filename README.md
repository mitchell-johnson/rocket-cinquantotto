# rocket-cinquantotto
Investigation into hacking the rocket cinquantotto USB UART output to export information and control the device. The ultimate goal is to integrate the machine into homeassistant will full control.  

The screen itself is the DMT48320C035_06WT the USB cable plugs stright into the Rx & Tx pins in the back

Writing a quick Arduio sketch on my Lolin D32 Board I am getting the following Hex strings when idle. Not sure what they mean yet. Im assuming they are the temp readings.
Based on the spec sheet using 115200 baud and strings are hex
#### Segment: `5AA509821041000100051654`
- `5AA5098210410001`: Header.
- `00051654`: Payload.

Also this random payload in there
#### Segment: `213014010100051654FF`
- This seems different, possibly indicating a different message type or corrupted data.
- `213014010100051654FF`: New potential header and payload.

In this series of the machine was heating up with times going . I would be expecting it to be producing temperature updates. I have splint the series by ending in 54 for the most part but then again by 5A as there were lots that didn't end in 54. For those that didn't end up in 54 seem to end in F5 with others EA, FF, FD, AE (maybe), 

5AA | 50 = the the first 5 is not the length. many packets have the same sequence but different lengths. However they are more frequently 22 chars it could also be 5A | A5 | 

- in the sequence there are 99 instances of 5AA50 and 98 of those are 5A|A5|09 with one being 5A|A5|0B


- different combos of the first 4 bytes
1. `5EA5`: 8 times
2. `5A69`: 11 times
3. `5AA7`: 13 times
4. `5AA5`: 99 times
5. `5AAD`: 1 times
6. `DA69`: 3 times
7. `FFA5`: 1 time
8. `5E69`: 1 time




5AA509821041000100051654 seems to be a common status message. Maybe a keep alive.
